# 🔬 Contact Lens Image Analysis Using Fourier Transform

This project demonstrates the use of **Fourier Transform (FFT)** for image analysis, simulating how a data scientist might support quality control in medical device manufacturing — specifically contact lens inspection.

## 🧠 Project Goal
Analyze a grayscale image to simulate detecting patterns or defects in a medical device using FFT. This technique is useful in manufacturing environments to improve production efficiency and detect image anomalies.

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-image
- OpenCV (optional for extension)
- FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)

## 📊 What’s Inside
- Load and visualize a simulated contact lens image
- Apply FFT and visualize frequency domain
- Summarize insights and how they apply to real-world manufacturing quality analysis

## 📁 Files
- `Contact_Lens_FFT_Analysis.ipynb`: The complete Jupyter notebook with code, visualizations, and commentary

## 📝 Results Summary
- Successfully applied Fourier Transform to a sample image
- Visualized spectral components useful for identifying structural regularities or defects
- Created a portable demonstration of how mathematical transforms support medical device risk remediation and optimization
